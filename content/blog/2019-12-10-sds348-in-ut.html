<p>This blog was created at December 10, 2019 to demostrate my ability of creating my own portfolio through R. I took SDS348 in UT with professor Woodward. I learned decent amount of knowledge regarding ggplot(), python and statistic analytic skills. The projects from this class were presented in Project tab</p>
